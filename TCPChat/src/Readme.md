## Simple TCP Chat
Within this directory you can find my solution to the following programming task:
>Write a simple tcp-chat using sockets. Server and Client have to be able to receive and send messages at the same time.

The thread to this task can be found at [lsw-board](https://linux-statt-windows.org/topic/1298/tcp-chat).

This solution is just a simple way and not a full chat solution. It is vulnerable to security problems like a DOS and others. Encryption is yet not implemented.
